Barium is a chemical element with the symbol Ba and atomic number 56.  
 It is a soft, silvery-white alkaline earth metal that is found naturally in the mineral barite (barium sulfate).  
  Barium is a highly reactive element and is not found in pure form in nature.  
   It has various applications in industry, medicine, and research.  

Here are some key points about barium:  

1. Physical properties:  
    Barium is a soft metal with a melting point of 727째C (1,341째F) and a boiling point of 1,890째C (3,434째F).  
     It is relatively dense, with a specific gravity of 3.62.  
      Barium has a shiny appearance when freshly cut, but it quickly oxidizes in air and forms a thin oxide layer.  

2. Chemical properties:   
    Barium is highly reactive, especially with water or acids, and should be handled with caution.  
     It readily forms compounds with elements like oxygen, sulfur, and halogens.  
      Barium compounds are often toxic and should be handled with care.  

3. Uses:  
    Barium has several applications across various industries.  
     One of the most common uses is in the production of barium sulfate,  
      which is used as a contrast agent in medical imaging procedures like X-rays and CT scans.  
       Barium compounds are also used in the production of ceramics, glass, and fireworks.  
        Additionally, barium is used in drilling fluids for oil and gas wells.  

4. Health effects:  
    Barium compounds, when ingested or inhaled, can be toxic to humans.  
     In particular, soluble barium salts are poisonous and can affect the cardiovascular, respiratory, and nervous systems.  
      Barium should be handled with appropriate safety measures, and exposure to barium compounds should be minimized.  

5. Environmental impact:  
    Barium itself is not considered highly toxic to the environment, but its compounds can have negative effects.  
     Barium can accumulate in soil and water, potentially impacting plants, aquatic organisms, and ecosystems.  
      Proper disposal and management of barium-containing materials are important to prevent environmental contamination.  

It's important to note that while I strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information,  
 the knowledge cutoff for this AI model is in September 2021. Therefore,  
  there may be some developments or discoveries about barium since then that I'm unaware of.
